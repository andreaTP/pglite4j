are those executables:
wasm-build/sdk/bin
remove or download correct versioned things

is wasmtime needed?

is emcc needed?

give a better structure to the repo and the build process, I want to see a clear pipeline:

- download the sources
- apply patches
- compile

build.sh and wasm-build.sh, what's the difference?
